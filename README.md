# Homework 05 - STAT545A

Welcome to Vetle's repository for Homework 05 in STAT545 - Exploratory Data Analysis. This repository is probably only of interest to you if you are either of the following:
(a) a TA or fellow student responsible for grading my work or
(b) a prospective future student, wondering what we learn in this course
If you are not one of the above and **still** would like to check out this repo, please, be my guest. Enjoy!

## Quick links

For people grading my work, please look at the md-file, as the Rmd-file does not include the plots.
